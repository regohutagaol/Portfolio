### Data Visualization
* [Visualizing COVID-19 Cases in ASEAN Countries](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://rawcdn.githack.com/regohutagaol/Portfolio/2728c3e4fca86c6701acfe40a4d66dbaf733f6ec/Visualizing%20COVID19%20Cases%20in%20ASEAN%20Countries/covid19asean.html)  
  This is a simple project to show pandas usage to manipulate data to the desired format and visualize the result using python's bar_chart_race package.

### Machine Learning
* [Predicting House Sale Prices Using RandomForestRegressor()](https://github.com/regohutagaol/Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices%20using%20Machine%20Learning/house.ipynb)  
  A miniproject to show clever feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to predict house sale prices using sklearn's Random Forest.

### Misc.
* [Calculating Genshin Impact Gacha Probabilities Using Simulation](https://github.com/regohutagaol/Portfolio/blob/main/Genshin%20Impact%20Gacha%20Probabilities/genshin.py)  
  In the game Genshin Impact, in every roll, the probability to get a 4 star item is 5.1% with guaranteed 1 4 star item every 10th roll. The probability to get 5 star item is 0.6% with guaranteed 5 star item every 90th roll. The advertised average probability is 13% for 4 star item and 1.6% for 5 star item. Because we don't trust the company and math is hard, we will calculate the probabilities ourself using simulations with random number generator.
